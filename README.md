## simple sieve tokenizer based on my madc tokenizer

---

I tried to find a simple sieve file tokenizer, and while there were
quite a few to be found, they were very poorly documented (or not at all)
and I decided it would be easier just to make my own rather than to
try and figure out undocumented libraries, especially since they seemed
to be overly complex, and I'm not sure they would even suit my needs.

My goals are:
1. Make it simple
2. Keep it small
3. Make it easy to use
4. Don't require extra libraries and dependencies

This only requires a standard C++ compiler.
